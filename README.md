# First project
My first project on here. I'm trying to connect **Khan Academy** to Github. 

## How to use
 - Create a **new website** on Khan Academy
 - **Include the library**. Just add this script tag to the **header**: `<script src = "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/infinite-coder-001/first/script.js"></script>`
 - Use the `change(id, value);` function
